Follow the evolution of your habits with my web site : [Habit Tracker Evolution] (https://habit-tracker-evolution.netlify.app/).

If you have suggestions to improve the site by adding new features, I would be immensely grateful for your help.

Here are some features I'd like to add (feel free to suggest your own ideas):

  - User authentication.
  - Saving habits to a database with authentication.
  - Organizing habits into multiple categories.
  - Make the code more secure without security vulnerability
